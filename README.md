NYC on Rails
==========

## The world's best web framework, in New York's most iconic borough ##

[NYC on Rails](http://nycrails.co) is a monthly meeting of Ruby/Rails developers which happens at [The Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com). Each month, a handful of presenters give short talks about cool technology projects they are building with Ruby/Rails.

This repository serves two primary purposes:

1. Talks are proposed via Github issues; just open up an issue [here](https://github.com/nycrails/nycrails.github.io/issues/new). Anybody who proposes a talk gets early priority access to tickets for that month regardless of whether the talk is accepted.

Hope to see you next time!
